                    <dd>With elegantly simple gameplay, Ticket to Ride can be learned in under 15 minutes. 
                        <br>Players collect cards of various types of train cars they then use to claim 
                        <br>railway routes in North America. The longer the routes, the more points they earn. 
                        <br>Additional points come to those who fulfill Destination Tickets goal cards that 
                        <br>connect distant cities; and to the player who builds the longest continuous route.

                        <br><br>"The rules are simple enough to write on a train ticket  each turn you either 
                        <br>draw more cards, claim a route, or get additional Destination Tickets," says Ticket 
                        <br>to Ride author, Alan R. Moon. "The tension comes from being forced to balance greed  
                        <br>adding more cards to your hand, and fear losing a critical route to a competitor."
                        
                        <br><br>Ticket to Ride continues in the tradition of Days of Wonder's big format board 
                        <br>games featuring high-quality illustrations and components including: an oversize 
                        <br>board map of North America, 225 custom-molded train cars, 144 illustrated cards, 
                        <br>and wooden scoring markers.
                        
                        <br><br>Since its introduction and numerous subsequent awards, Ticket to Ride has 
                        <br>become the BoardGameGeek epitome of a "gateway game" -- simple enough to be 
                        <br>taught in a few minutes, and with enough action and tension to keep new players 
                        <br>involved and in the game for the duration.
                        <br>play it again and again, and no two games are ever the same.

                <dt>Overview:</dt>
                <br>
                    <dd>In Pandemic, several virulent diseases have broken out simultaneously all over the 
                        <br>world! The players are disease-fighting specialists whose mission is to treat 
                        <br>disease hotspots while researching cures for each of four plagues before they 
                        <br>get out of hand.

                        <br><br>The game board depicts several major population centers on Earth. On each 
                        <br>turn, a player can use up to four actions to travel between cities, treat 
                        <br>infected populaces, discover a cure, or build a research station. A deck of 
                        <br>cards provides the players with these abilities, but sprinkled throughout this 
                        <br>deck are Epidemic! cards that accelerate and intensify the diseases' activity. 
                        <br>A second, separate deck of cards controls the "normal" spread of the infections.
                        
                        <br><br>Taking a unique role within the team, players must plan their strategy to 
                        <br>mesh with their specialists' strengths in order to conquer the diseases. For 
                        <br>example, the Operations Expert can build research stations which are needed to 
                        <br>find cures for the diseases and which allow for greater mobility between cities; 
                        <br>the Scientist needs only four cards of a particular disease to cure it instead 
                        <br>of the normal five—but the diseases are spreading quickly and time is running out. 
                        <br>If one or more diseases spreads beyond recovery or if too much time elapses, 
                        <br>the players all lose. If they cure the four diseases, they all win!
                        
                        <br><br>The 2013 edition of Pandemic includes two new characters—the Contingency 
                        <br>Planner and the Quarantine Specialist—not available in earlier editions of the game.
