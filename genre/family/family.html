                    <dd>While manning your fire tower you notice smoke in the distance and pull out your 
                        <br>radio to report a blaze growing somewhere in the forest. You must protect your tower 
                        <br>with all the resources at your disposal: dispatch fire engines to combat the blaze,
                        <br>order air drops of water, and plan the building of firebreaks. Competing fire 
                        <br>departments will complicate your work, using the unrelenting winds to their advantage 
                        <br>in an attempt to safeguard their own towers and threaten yours. The chaotic Firestorm 
                        <br>also stalks the deck and will dramatically swell the flames each time it is drawn. 
                        <br>Will you effectively use your forces to outwit your opponents and survive the inferno? 
                        <br>Can you be the last tower standing?

                    <dd>Sequence is a board and card game. The board shows all the cards (except for the Jacks)
                        <br>of two (2) standard 52-card decks, laid in a 10 x 10 pattern. The four corners are 
                        <br>free spaces and count for all players equally. The players compete to create rows,
                        <br>columns or diagonals of 5 connected checkers placed on the cards that the player  
                        <br>has laid down. Two-eyed Jacks are wild, while one-eyed Jacks allow an opponent's
                        <br>checker to be removed. The game ends when someone has reached a specified number of connections.
