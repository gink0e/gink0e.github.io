                <br>
                    <dd>One Night Ultimate Werewolf is a fast game for 3-10 players in which everyone gets a role: 
                        <br>One of the dastardly Werewolves, the tricky Troublemaker, the helpful Seer, or one of
                        <br>a dozen different characters, each with a special ability. In the course of a single
                        <br>morning, your village will decide who is a werewolf...because all it takes is lynching
                        <br>one werewolf to win!
                        <br><br>Because One Night Ultimate Werewolf is so fast, fun, and engaging, you'll want to 
                        <br>play it again and again, and no two games are ever the same.

            <h2>Secret Hitler</h2>
            <dl>
                <dt>Overview:</dt>
                <br>
                    <dd>Secret Hitler is a dramatic game of political intrigue and betrayal set in 1930s Germany. 
                        <br>Each player is randomly and secretly assigned to be a liberal or a fascist, and one 
                        <br>player is Secret Hitler. The fascists coordinate to sow distrust and install their 
                        <br>cold-blooded leader; the liberals must find and stop the Secret Hitler before it's 
                        <br>too late. The liberal team always has a majority.

                        <br><br>At the beginning of the game, players close their eyes, and the fascists reveal 
                        <br>themselves to one another. Secret Hitler keeps his eyes closed, but puts his thumb 
                        <br>up so the fascists can see who he is. The fascists learn who Hitler is, but Hitler 
                        <br>doesn't know who his fellow fascists are, and the liberals don't know who anyone is.
                        
                        <br><br>Each round, players elect a President and a Chancellor who will work together
                        <br>to enact a law from a random deck. If the government passes a fascist law, players
                        <br>must try to figure out if they were betrayed or simply unlucky. Secret Hitler also 
                        <br>features government powers that come into play as fascism advances. The fascists 
                        <br>will use those powers to create chaos unless liberals can pull the nation back 
                        <br>from the brink of war.
                        <br><br>The objective of the liberal team is to pass five liberal policies or 
                        <br>assassinate Secret Hitler. The objective of the fascist team is to pass six 
                        <br>fascist policies or elect Secret Hitler chancellor after three fascist policies 
                        <br>have passed.
